# Frequency Balancing for OoT Bingo

This repository provides a script to balance the frequency of how often goals appear in OoT Bingo.

## Setup

This script needs Node.js and NPM to be installed. To initialize the script, simply run `npm install`.

## Run the Script

Assuming the files `generator.js` (which includes the seedrandom implementation) and `goal-list.js` are up to date, the script can be run using the command `npm start`. The balanced goal list will be stored in the file `new-goals.json`.
